## Install the MySQL extension

If you don't already have Azure Data Studio installed, see its [install instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio).

1. Select the extensions icon from the sidebar in Azure Data Studio.

2. Search for the **MySQL** and select it.

3. Select **Install**. Once installed, select **Reload** to activate the extension in Azure Data Studio.

## Offline Installation

The extension will download and install a required MySQL Tools Service package during activation. For machines with no Internet access, you can still use the extension by choosing the
`Install from VSIX...` option in the Extension view and installing a bundled release from our [Releases] page.
Each operating system has a .vsix file with the required service included. Pick the file for your OS, download and install to get started.
We recommend you choose a full release and ignore any alpha or beta releases as these are our daily builds used in testing.

## Telemetry

This extension collects telemetry data, which is used to help understand how to improve the product. For example, this usage data helps to debug issues, such as slow start-up times, and to prioritize new features. While we appreciate the insights this data provides, we also know that not everyone wants to send usage data and you can disable telemetry as described in the Azure Data Studio [disable telemetry reporting](https://github.com/Microsoft/azuredatastudio/wiki/How-to-Disable-Telemetry-Reporting#how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting) documentation.
