## Install the MySQL extension (preview)

If you don't already have Azure Data Studio installed, see its [install instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio).

1. Select the extensions icon from the sidebar in Azure Data Studio.

2. Search for the **MySQL** and select it.

3. Select **Install**. Once installed, select **Reload** to activate the extension in Azure Data Studio.

**Note**: The extension is currently available in Azure Data Studio insider build only. To use the extension with Azure Data Studio general availability (GA) release, follow the **Offline Installation** instructions below.

## Offline Installation

The extension will download and install a required MySQL Tools Service package during activation. For machines with no Internet access, you can still use the extension by choosing the
`Install from VSIX...` option in the Extension view and installing a bundled release from our [Releases] page.
Each operating system has a .vsix file with the required service included. Pick the file for your OS, download and install to get started.
We recommend you choose a full release and ignore any alpha or beta releases as these are our daily builds used in testing.
